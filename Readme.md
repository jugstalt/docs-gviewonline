gView GIS Dokumention
=====================

This repository contains the online documentation for [gView GIS](https://github.com/jugstalt/gview5).
The documentation is created using RestructuredText. The html documents are built with Sphinx.

The online documentation is available here:

* [English](https://docs.webgiscloud.com/gview/en/index.html)
* [German](https://docs.webgiscloud.com/gview/de/index.html)

Creating a complete and up-to-date online documentation takes a lot of time. 
gView GIS is open source software if you want to contribute something to the software, then support me with the documentation.
Thank you!
