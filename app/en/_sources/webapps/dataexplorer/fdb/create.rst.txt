Creating an MS SQL Feature Database
=====================================

This database is a proprietary format and can only be used with gView GIS. However, the advantage is the high performance with 
large data volumes. Additionally, this format allows for the creation and management of image catalogs in a comfortable graphical 
interface. A prerequisite for creating a database is MS SQLServer 2008 or higher. If the free Express version of MS SQL is used, 
the corresponding limitations of the server apply (max. 4GB per database, etc.). However, these restrictions do not limit the 
Feature Database functionality.

.. note::
   The method shown here refers to a *gView Feature Database* in SQLServer. 
   The creation of a *gView Feature Database* in Postgres is analogous.
   To create a *gView Feature Database* based on SQLite, first navigate to the location in the filesystem where the database 
   should be created. In the *Context Menu*, you can then select ``Create New: SQLite Feature Database``.

To create a new Feature Database, select the node ``Database / gView Feature Database Connections (MS-SQL Server)`` in the tree view:

.. image:: img/create1.png

In the toolbar, in the Context Block ``Create new``, the tool ``SQL Server Feature Database`` is offered. Clicking on it opens the 
following dialog:

.. image:: img/create2.png

Here, set up the connection to the SQL Server instance. The connection type specifies whether to log in via Windows authentication 
or using a username and password. The database name completes the properties of the new database.

After confirmation with ``OK``, the database is created with all necessary tables. If the creation is successful, the Data Explorer 
shows the new database icon in the *Contents area*:


.. image:: img/create3.png 

The icons in the *Contents area* are always opened with a double click. You can also create a connection icon to an 
existing Feature Database this way. Simply double-click the icon ``Create New Connectionâ€¦``

.. image:: img/create4.png 

This way, more icons for the sample database with administrator rights can be created:

.. image:: img/create5.png 

Using the context toolbar of an icon, it can finally be renamed:

.. image:: img/create6.png 

The next step is to create a dataset for geospatial data. Datasets are
collections of feature classes that possess similar properties. For example,
all classes belonging to the cadastral system can be placed in a dataset labeled
CADASTRE.

.. note::
    All feature classes within a dataset use the same spatial reference system! 
    If data is in different reference systems, the feature classes must be divided into multiple datasets. 
    A **feature class name** can only occur **once** in a **database**.
    
To create a new dataset, double-click on the database icon
(MY_FDB@localhost (admin)) in the *Contents area*. Since no datasets exist yet, only
an empty area appears. In the Context Block ``Create new`` in the toolbar, a
tool ``SQL Feature Database Dataset`` is offered, which opens the following dialog:

    
.. image:: img/create7.png 

You can name it ``Dataset1``. The type remains ``Feature Dataset``.
This means that vector data for all geometry types (point, line,
area) can be stored in this dataset. The type Image Dataset is intended for creating
image catalogs and will be discussed in the next section.

The second tab of the dialog specifies the spatial reference system for the
dataset. As mentioned above, the reference system can only be determined at this level.
All feature classes in a dataset inherit this property.

A spatial reference system always consists of two parts (coordinate system and
geodetic datum), although the second part can theoretically be omitted. However, no datum transition is applied during projection. With the
``Select``, you can choose from predefined systems:

.. image:: img/create8.png 

To narrow down the list, you can enter a search term (e.g., Austria, EPSG code).
Clicking on the desired coordinate system closes the dialog. 
The procedure for the geodetic datum is identical. In some
projections, the datum is already included. After making a selection, the dialog
looks approximately like this:

.. image:: img/create9.png 

The third tab ``Spatial Index`` allows you to create a prototype for the spatial
index of the dataset. Whenever a new feature class is created, this
prototype is suggested. However, since a separate index can be created for each feature class later,
the provision of this prototype is optional.

After confirming the dialog, the new *Dataset* is created:

.. image:: img/create11.png 

The context tools of the dataset icon can be used to rename it. It is also possible to 
change the parameters of the spatial reference system afterwards.

.. note::
    If the spatial reference system is changed retrospectively, the feature classes in the
    dataset are not reprojected. This means that the coordinates of the features remain the same. 
    Only the projection parameters inherited from the dataset are changed.

In the next step, data from an ESRI Shapefile should be copied into the SQL Feature Database. 
To do this, navigate through the tree view to the directory where the shape data is located.

.. image:: img/create12.png 

First, select the desired files. As usual, multiple files can be marked using the Shift or 
Control key. In the context area of the toolbar, the ``Copy`` button appears. Clicking on 
the button copies the data to the clipboard.

.. note::

    The data is not copied to the Windows clipboard but to the **gView.DataExplorer**
    clipboard of the current session. Data cannot be copied to other programs.
    It is also not possible to copy from one **gView.DataExplorer** window to another.

Navigate back to the dataset created earlier; the *Contents area* of the dataset is still empty.
After clicking the ``Paste`` button in the context area of the toolbar, the following dialog appears:

.. image:: img/create13.png 

The copying process is started by clicking the ``Start`` button:

.. image:: img/create13a.png 

Once the copying process is successfully completed, the dialog can be closed with ``Close``, 
and the new *Feature Classes* are displayed.

Now double-click on one of the newly created Feature Class icons. 
In the *Contents view*, the fields with their respective field types appear:

.. image:: img/create14.png 

In addition to the ``FeatureClass`` tab, another tab appears: ``Data View``. 
This is used to display the content of the feature classes. Both geometry and data are displayed:

.. image:: img/create15.png 

Navigation in the map occurs as in **gView.Carto** by dragging with the mouse button 
(moving) or using the mouse wheel (zooming). The table area can be enlarged or reduced 
with the arrow keys.

In addition to importing data into a *SQL Feature Database*, this data can also be
exported. To do this, proceed in the opposite way as described above. First, mark and copy 
the feature classes. Then navigate to the destination folder and paste them there. When copying 
data back into the file system, the output format must be specified in the copy dialog:

.. image:: img/create19.png 

Besides *ESRI Shape* file, the *OGC GML* format is also possible. Both formats are
readable by most GIS systems and are therefore very suitable for exchanging data
between different systems.
