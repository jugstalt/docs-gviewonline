More layer properties
=====================

In addition to the setting options already described, the Layer Properties dialog offers further tabs.
These are listed here only rudimentarily:

* **Selection:** The representation of selected objects of a layer. The tab corresponds in functionality to the ``Symbology`` tab

* **Filter:** here a SQL statement can be generated via a query editor, which serves as a filter for the displayable and queryable objects of this layer. 
  For example, not all objects are displayed for a layer, but only those that fits to the filter.

* **Spatial reference and source:** These tabs are only used to provide information about the origin and spatial reference of the layer. No properties can be changed here by the user.
