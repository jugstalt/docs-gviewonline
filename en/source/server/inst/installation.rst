Installation
============

In the section Installation of *gView GIS* it has already been shown how the server uses a batch file ``gView Server.bat``
can be started. This corresponds in principle to the *standalone* variant and is particularly suitable for local test installation
and offline solutions.

All possible installation scenarios are presented here. In addition, after the first start there is still a *postinalallation*
via the web interface.
