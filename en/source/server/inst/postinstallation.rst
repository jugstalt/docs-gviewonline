Postinstallation
================

After installing the *gView Server*, the post installation follows. The first time the server is called from the browser
you may see the following message:

This error message indicates that the configuration of the server is not yet correct.
In the example here, the file _config/mapserver.json does not yet exist. The form and function 
this file is shown in the **Configuration** section.

After successful configuration, the application appears after the first call as follows:

The red **Manage** button indicates that no administrator has yet been created. The *gView Server*
requires an administrator user who is allowed to create **Logins** and **Folders** (card service directories). 

As long as this button is red, this administrator must be created. To create the
administrators click on the red tile and choose a user name and password for the
administrator:

If the password is not strong enough, a stronger password may need to be provided.
After successfully creating the administrator, the interface switches to the **Manage** tools.
This is only visible to the administrator after successful logon:
