Examples
========

This section presents application examples that show a practical approach to gView GIS.
The examples shown here are, for example:

* You can create a cartographically appealing map map (roads, buildings) and calculate Tilecache tiles for this map in order to publish the content as a WMTS service. 
* Automated change of (database) connection properties of MXL files (Map XML - gView map project files) via the command line and publish the maps in the gView server via the command line
